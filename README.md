# Satellite-Orbit-Prediction
Try to predict satellite orbit parameters in the future using the past TLE data and using ML, NN and fitting techniques.
See the results and the code in the [notebook](https://github.com/YasinSonmez/Satellite-Orbit-Prediction/blob/main/SGP4.ipynb)

Here is what we achieved in this project:
- Using SGP4 to predict future coordinates of the satellite
- Plotting orbital parameters compared to time using the past TLE data
- Plotting the satellite orbit in 3D using TLE data
- Fitting curves to the data using linear fitting, function fitting and LSTMs
- Synthesizing TLE from the orbital data
- Calculating the difference of 2 TLEs

# Results
Using the TLE data of the GOKTURK-2 Satellite, following results are gathered
